It stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging. ISTJ indicates a person who is energized by time spent alone (Introverted), who focuses on facts and details rather than ideas and concepts (Sensing), who makes decisions based on logic and reason (Thinking) and who prefers to be planned and organized rather than spontaneous and flexible (Judging). ISTJs are sometimes referred to as Inspector personalities because of their focus on details and interest in doing things correctly.ISTJs are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. Reliable and dutiful, ISTJs want to uphold tradition and follow regulations.\nISTJs are steady, productive contributors. Although they are Introverted, ISTJs are rarely isolated; typical ISTJs know just where they belong in life, and want to understand how they can participate in established organizations and systems. They concern themselves with maintaining the social order and making sure that standards are met. \n\nWhat does ISTJ Stand for?\nThe 	ISTJ personality type is one of the 16 distinct personality types outlined by MBTI, and stands for Introverted, Sensing, Thinking and Judging.Those with an ISTJ result are said to be logical, quiet, grounded, organized and productive. Thanks to their introverted style and focus on order, rules and details, ISTJs are occasionally nicknamed the Logistician or the Inspector.

	\nINFJ/n/tThe Counselor/n/tInsightful Visionary(MBTI)/n/tAdvocate(16Personalities)\n\nWhat is INFJ Personality Type\nINFJ stands for introverted, intuitive, feeling, and judging, and it's the rarest Myers-Briggs personality type, making up only 1 to 3% of the population. As clinical psychologist Kristina Hallett, Ph.D., ABPP, previously explained to mbg, your type is determined by where you fall on the four different trait spectrums of the MBTI, which are introverted versus extroverted, intuitive versus sensing, thinking versus feeling, and sensing versus judging. So, an INFJ is someone who is typically more introverted and relies on their intuition to gather information. They also make decisions through feelings and emotions as opposed to logic, and they prefer to approach their life with more structure and scheduling as opposed to flexibility and spontaneity. \n\nWhat does INFJ Stand for?\nINFJ stands for Introvert, Intuition, Feeling, and Judging. The INFJ is one of the 16 personality types according to the theory of Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers.\nINFJ personality types are:\nIntroverts: They gain energy by spendingtime alone and get drained by too much external stimulation.\nIntuitives: They are more concerned with the abstract world than the concrete. INFJs are fascinated by theories, ideas, and symbolism.\nFeelers: They make decisions based on how their choices will impact other people. INFJs are in tune with how other people feel.\nJudgers: They are decisive and prefer an organized external world. INFJs are hyper-aware of time and they work better with structure and routine.\n
While INFJs are very much introverts, they have a strong love of people and this extends to all of humanity. They genuinely care about understanding others and society at large.\n INFJs prefer not to draw attention to themselves, so they’ll often hide part of their personality until they feel like they can truly trust the person or people around them. While they’re slow to warm up to others, many INFJs are skilled at making other people feel comfortable. INFJs are future-oriented idealists. This personality type is easily able to see the big picture and predict the outcomes and implications of current events far into the future.Many INFJs profess feeling like they have psychic powers because of their ability to recognize patterns and intuitively assess how events will unfold.

	\nINTJ\n\tThe Mastermind\n\tArchitect(16Personalities)\n\tConceptual Planner(MBTI)\n\nWhat is INTJ Personality Type\nThe INTJ personality type, also known as the Mastermind, refers to people who are Introverted, iNtuitive, Thinking, and Judging (INTJ). Individuals with this personality type have an analytical, innovative mindset that’s rooted in logic.The INTJ personality is characterized by four dominant attitudes, first identified by psychologist Carl Jung and used in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to describe the sixteen common personality types. INTJ personalities are often called the Mastermind because of their propensity for analysis and innovation. The Architect is a common archetype used to describe INTJs. An easy way to understand the INTJ personality is to consider the characteristics of a good architect, such as methodical planning and overcoming design challenges through innovation. INTJs approach life with the same penchant for analysis, thorough planning, and creativity.\nINTJs possess three discernible characteristics. Firstly, INTJ personalities are focused inward, quietly immersing themselves in the study of the world around them. Secondly, INTJs prefer to think strategically, in concepts and ideas, often focusing on the big picture rather than minute details. Thirdly, INTJs will always defer to logic to problem solve. INTJ personalities’ main strength is their passion for learning how various processes around them work. The deep knowledge they accumulate over time allows them to think strategically and come up with innovative ways to solve problems. At the same time, INTJs’ awareness of their own intellectual capacity is their Achilles’ heel, and can lead them to develop a superiority complex. This feeling of preeminence may cause Masterminds to act in a patronizing manner that alienates others.\n\nWhat Does INTJ Stand for?\nINTJ stands for Introversion, iNtuition, Thinking, and Judging. These are four out of eight possible Jungian personality traits, which exist in opposition to one another. Introversion is the opposite of Extraversion; iNtuition of Sensing; Thinking of Feeling; and Judging of Perceiving. The unique combination of INTJ’s dominant characteristics yields the Mastermind personality archetype. INTJs keep to themselves, think strategically, rely on logic, and are seen as rational rather than emotional.

They’re often characterized as innovative thinkers unafraid to challenge conventions. Quick-witted and strategic, ENTPs relish intellectual debates and exploring novel ideas.

But don't let that scare you off—ENTPs are also open-minded, curious, and invested in their own personal growth, and they can make great friends or partners (if you can handle their brashness). Quick-witted and audacious, people with the ENTP personality type (Debaters) aren’t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they’re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone.

It would be a mistake, though, to think of ENTPs as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun – one that usually involves a healthy dose of spirited debate.

	ISFP\n\tThe Composer\n\tAdventurer(16Personalities)\n\tVersatile Supporter(MBTI)\n\nWhat is ISFP Personality type/nISFPs find rejuvenation in solitude (Introversion), lean towards tangible experiences and present realities over abstract possibilities (Sensing), base decisions on personal values and emotional implications rather than logical analysis (Feeling), and value adaptability and live-in-the-moment experiences over strict plans (Perceiving). People with this personality type tend to be peaceful, easy-going, and down-to-earth individuals. They have a strong need for personal space and value time alone to recharge. They appreciate deep connections and enjoy spending time with their small circle of close friends and family. They are highly considerate and accepting, committed to their values and to the people who are important to them. ISFPs are sometimes referred to as /“the Artist,/” /“the Composer,/” or /“the Adventurer./” ISFP is the opposite personality type of ENTJ. ISFP is the fourth most common type in the population. ISFPs enjoy providing practical help or service to others, as well as bringing people together and facilitating and encouraging their cooperation. ISFPs are typically cooperative, modest and adaptable and also gentle and loyal.\n\nWhat does ISFP stand for?\nWhat is ISFP? As you’re probably aware, the four letters of each personality type stand for their preferences. In the case of the ISFP, those are Introversion (I), Sensing (S), Feeling (F), and Perceiving (P). People with the ISFP personality type (Adventurers) are true artists – although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For these types, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, they act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. With their exploratory spirit and their ability to find joy in everyday life, ISFPs can be among the most interesting people you’ll ever meet. Driven by their sense of fairness and their open-mindedness, people with this personality type move through life with an infectiously encouraging attitude. They love motivating those close to them to follow their passions and usually follow their own interests with the same unhindered enthusiasm. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, ISFPs tend to see themselves as /“just doing their own thing,/” so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are.
